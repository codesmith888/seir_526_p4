## 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫 teacher's helper 🐷🐸🐶
  * By Caitlin Smith 
  * Full stack NRG web application using Nodejs, React and GraphQL
  * Teachers everywhere are going back to school virtually or in a hybrid model where they need to provide instruction to students both virtually AND in person! Can't be in two places at once?! Don't have time to teach lessons in advance AND teach live lessons? Teacher's Helper is here to save the day! Simply create an assignment, type in directions, choose a Teacher's Helper and let THEM teach the lesson for you!

Answer: 
1. How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology?
  * I have found an edX course online and have already started the introduction lessons. I will not be able to finish the course before P4 is due, but I want to get through the introduction lessons and then read through the documentation. 
2. What is your goal with this project?
  * I want to fully create this app with auth post-cohort. This is something I want to use in my own classroom and I think there is a need for this service, particularly with many schools doing fully-remote learning and looking at a year with hybrid learning at least. 
3. Who is the user for your app?
  * Users are teachers, tutors, and educators everywhere! Anyone who needs to be able to give step by step directions but doesn't have the time or energy to film lessons before every lesson! 
4. Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into?
  * Honestly, I have been reading about GraphQL and I am still confused about how to implement it, so I think the learning curve about how to use GraphQl to query my backend may be steep. I also know that MVP for this project will not have auth unless I magically gain SUPERSPEED coding powers... so that is something I will want to add on post-cohort. I also chose this project because I want to spend a lot of time on fun CSS features because that is another thing that I want to work on. I am hoping to implement some animation and hover features, etc.!
